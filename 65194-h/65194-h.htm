<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Gather &#8217;round me closely and a story I&#8217;ll relate</div>
<div class="verse">Of life in different stages&mdash;its sad and happy state&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">When as a youth, before the storm and all the world is fair,</div>
<div class="verse">And then a man of middle-age, with nothing left but care.</div>
<div class="verse">Life&#8217;s story has a happy hue and the world seems bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, life is full of sunshine, we can not see the night,</div>
<div class="verse">And we with hearts all filled with plans, look forward and we see</div>
<div class="verse">With eyes of hope, our future fights end in a victory.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But when the days of youth are o&#8217;er, storms gather thick and fast,</div>
<div class="verse">The happiness of childhood has vanished with the past.</div>
<div class="verse">Instead of all our victories and conquest to attain,</div>
<div class="verse">Our fight is principally in life, our daily bread to gain.</div>
<div class="verse">Our plans have all been shattered; castles gone to decay;</div>
<div class="verse">Our childhood dreams of happiness have long since passed away.</div>
<div class="verse">No sunshine now we see in life, all is grief and despair,</div>
<div class="verse">Our joyful dreams of former years turned to trials, toil and care.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In old age we look back to these things we labored after.</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes it causes sorrow; sometimes it causes laughter.</div>
<div class="verse">Some of our best days were ill spent in joy and dissipation,</div>
<div class="verse">Or mayhap some mistake in life, such as missing a vocation.</div>
<div class="verse">Such things will hover &#8217;round our minds when we have all turned gray,</div>
<div class="verse">But what&#8217;s the use of pining for things long passed away,</div>
<div class="verse">For if we had the means wherewith, our lives we could relive;</div>
<div class="verse">We&#8217;d do the same and to these same hopes we would a nursing give.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Life has its joys and sorrows; its sunshine and its rain;</div>
<div class="verse">Its griefs and disappointments; its happiness and pain.</div>
<div class="verse">We struggle hard for happiness, think we have a boundless store,</div>
<div class="verse">When the monster disappointment comes knocking at the door.</div>

<div class="verse">Millions have I in my deep bed; millions in silver; millions in gold;</div>
<div class="verse">Stones that are precious, jewels so rare;</div>
<div class="verse">Relics of kingdoms beyond compare.</div>
<div class="verse">Antiques that are centuries old.</div>
<div class="verse">It was echoes from the sea, whispering to me;</div>
<div class="verse">Echoes floating out into the air.</div>
<div class="verse">Stories to me told of wealth and shining gold</div>
<div class="verse">That are hidden in the mighty ocean there.</div>
</div>

<div class="verse">Then it spoke of vessels proud</div>

<div class="verse">The sea with its might they&#8217;d gladly fight,</div>
<div class="verse">No power on earth could make them fall,</div>
<div class="verse">But each brave ship, as it came their turn, gave up the fight (if the story be true);</div>

<div class="verse">Ne&#8217;er again will they sail so gay.</div>
<div class="verse">Relinquished all and sank from view.</div>
<div class="verse">It was echoes from the sea, whispering to me;</div>

<div class="verse">Stories to me told of gallant ships of old</div>
<div class="verse">That are hidden in the mighty ocean there.</div>
</div>

<div class="verse">Next it spoke of seamen gay;</div>
<div class="verse">Of sailors that were brave and true,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose boasts would be, &#8220;We sail the sea;</div>
<div class="verse">We sail the mighty ocean blue.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">They sailed away in their gallant bark, these heroes who were staunch and brave.</div>
<div class="verse">Those at home they weep and yearn</div>
<div class="verse">For these gallant tars who&#8217;ll not return,</div>
<div class="verse">But sleep in a watery grave,</div>
<div class="verse">It was echoes from the sea, whispering to me,</div>
<div class="verse">Echoes floating out into the air.</div>
<div class="verse">Stories to me told of sailors brave and bold,</div>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
